This is a script for ArchLinux that can install or upgrade AUR packages.
It is used like this:
	goaur install [aurpackage]
	goaur upgrade

For devel packages (git, hg, etc...) if there's a dir with the same name
as the devel package in ~/Builds it will update that directory so you
don't have to checkout all the sources all the time.
